happy pride!

hey! click through the rainbow!

today i learned a bunch about making buttons, and made my brain into
mush with a little bit of javascript.

at the end of my loop, it required 3 clicks to get back to the start of
the loop, which i don’t fully understand yet. i’ll stare at it again
once i’ve ate more than protein bars.

happy toronto pride! <333
